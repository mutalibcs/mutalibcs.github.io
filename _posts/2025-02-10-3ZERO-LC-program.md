## Celebrating My Achievement: Completing the 3ZERO Leadership Challenge  

I am thrilled to share that I have successfully completed the **4th 3ZERO Leadership Challenge (3ZLC) program**! This prestigious program was held on **August 30, 2024, at the SocialTech Summit 2024**, along with pre-online sessions.  
As a recognition of my participation and successful completion of the program, I have been awarded a **certificate of achievement**. You can view my certificate [here](/files/3ZeroClub/Certificate.pdf).  


The **3ZERO initiative** is a global movement striving for a world with **Zero Exclusion, Zero Carbon, and Zero Poverty**. It addresses pressing global challenges such as climate change, economic disparities, and social injustices, aiming to create a sustainable and inclusive future for all. The initiative was launched in **2017 by Convergences**, a reflection, mobilisation, and advocacy platform. Since its inception, Convergences has organised **3ZERO Forums** in various countries to foster multi-actor dialogue and partnerships, facilitating the achievement of the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** and the 3ZERO objectives.  

The **3ZLC program**, themed *"3ZERO for Global Peace: Voice from Asian Gen Z,"* aimed to harness the **innovative spirit and global perspectives** of Generation Z across Asia. It focused on promoting an **inclusive, sustainable, and peaceful world** while fostering leadership skills among young visionaries dedicated to making a difference.  

The program included an **online workshop**, where participants engaged in insightful discussions on leadership and social impact. This was followed by a **3-minute video presentation**, where participants showcased their ideas and learnings on global peace. In **November 2024, Pope Francis and Nobel Peace laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus** launched the *Pope Francis Yunus 3Zero Club* in Rome. This initiative empowers marginalized youth by providing platforms to develop innovative and sustainable solutions, furthering the mission of achieving **zero poverty, zero unemployment, and zero net carbon emissions**.  

My participation in the **3ZERO Leadership Challenge** was an **enriching experience**. The program provided an **interactive learning environment**, where I had the opportunity to **network and collaborate with like-minded individuals**. Through the online sessions and video presentation, I developed a deeper understanding of leadership, sustainability, and social impact.  

This achievement marks the **beginning of my journey towards impactful leadership**. Completing this challenge has been an incredible experience, and my **certificate of achievement** is a testament to my dedication to driving positive change. I encourage more young leaders to participate in future editions of the **3ZERO Leadership Challenge** and contribute to shaping a more inclusive and sustainable world.  

The **3ZERO Leadership Challenge** was **organized and supported** by esteemed institutions, including **3ZERO Trust, Social Business Academia Network, Kyushu University (Institute for Asian and Oceanian Studies - Q-AOS), UDDOKTA, and 3ZERO CLUB Japan**. I extend my gratitude to **Nazneen Sultana**, Trustee of 3ZERO Trust, **Professor Shuji Shimizu**, Executive Research Director at QAOS and Vice President of Kyushu University, and **Dr. Ashir Ahmed**, Associate Professor at the Faculty of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, Kyushu University, for their invaluable contributions in making this program a success.  

I am **proud of this milestone and excited for what lies ahead**! For more information about the **3ZERO movement** and its initiatives, visit **[3ZERO.org](https://www.3zero.org)**.
